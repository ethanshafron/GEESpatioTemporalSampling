# GEESpatioTemporalSampling
Functions to assist with aligning samples collected at specific dates with views from above from as close to the same date as possible.

Largely taken from [https://smithsonian.github.io/SpatiotemporalMatchingOfAnimalPositionsWithRemotelySensedDataUsingGoogleEarthEngineAndR/](this implementation), with some aspects of the codebase cleaned up a bit and wrapped into a nice little function.
